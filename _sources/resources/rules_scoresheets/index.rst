.. admonition:: DRAFT RULES

   The DRAFT rules for the 2025 season have been released and can be found on the rule pages!


The official OnStage rules are used during the international RoboCupJunior competition. It is recomended for organizers of regional events to apply them in the same form to ensure consistency.
Please also note the `RoboCupJunior General Rules <https://junior.robocup.org/robocupjunior-general-rules/>`__.

Regional and super-regional events may also offer a OnStage Entry league, which is open for all teams, that only consist of members that don't reach the minimum age specified
in the `General Rules <https://junior.robocup.org/robocupjunior-general-rules/>`__. A simplified version of the OnStage rules is provided for these competitions.

.. caution::

   Please check with the local organization of your event which rules will be applied!

.. caution::

   There will be no OnStage Entry league at the international RoboCupJunior event!


The OnStage rules are managed in a separate `GitHub repository <https://github.com/robocup-junior/onstage-rules/>`__. Scoresheets are about to be migrated there soon.
See the readme to find out more.
