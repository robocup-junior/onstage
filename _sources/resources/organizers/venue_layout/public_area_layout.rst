Public Area
===========

The public area is open to visitors and should be designed to ensure that participants have easy access to the performance area on stage. It should also provide a clear view for the audience to watch the teams' performances.

The figure below illustrates an exemplary floor plan of the public space, including the stage, seating area, and AV-Desk (FOH â€“ *Front of House*), where all AV control systems are located. It also displays the recommended AV signal routing between components.

The following setup is recommended for hosting a successful OnStage competition. Components required by the rules are written in **bold**.

Audio / PA-System
-----------------

The following audio devices are controlled by a mixer located at the FOH:

- **Speakers** for the audience
- *Optional:* Monitor speakers for participants on stage
- **Two wireless microphones** on stage for team use
- *Optional:* An additional wireless microphone for the stage host / MC
- **Computer** to play media provided by participants
- **3.5 mm audio jack with ~6 m cable on stage**, allowing teams to connect their robots to the audio system

Video System
------------

The following video devices are controlled by an HDMI mixer at the FOH:

- **LED wall or projector with screen**, positioned at least 1.5 m above the stage floor
- **Computer** to play media provided by participants (can be the same as for audio)
- **HDMI plug with ~6 m cable on stage**, allowing teams to connect their robots to the video system

Additionally, a wireless presenter for controlling slides is helpful for the teams.

Timer System
------------

During performances, two timers must be displayed on a separate screen:

1. A **countdown timer** showing the maximum time a team is allowed on stage, including setup and clearing (7 minutes)
2. A **stopwatch timer** measuring the team's actual performance time, excluding setup

Equipment required:

- TV screen (~48 inches) placed near the stage
- Dedicated computer at the FOH

Recommended software for displaying the timers:

- **Countdown Timer:** `Webuhr Online Timer <https://webuhr.de/timer/#countdown=00:07:00&enabled=0&seconds=420&onzero=2&title=Stage+Time&showmessage=0&sound=xylophone&loop=1>`__ in fullscreen mode
- **Stopwatch:** Windows stopwatch in pinned mode to ensure it remains visible above the countdown
