Interview Room
==============

The interview room will be used by the judging panel on one or two days of the competition to assess the participants' understanding of their project. Depending on the schedule and the number of teams, one or two rooms may be required.

Layout
------

Each interview room should be approximately **35 mÂ²** in size. The entrance should be as wide as possible to allow teams to bring in large robots or props without difficulty.

Equipment
---------

The room should be equipped similarly to a standard conference room. A table with seating for approximately 10 people must be provided.

The following infrastructure is required:

- **Power outlets** for charging mobile devices (judges may use up to three)
- **Internet access**, either wired or reliable Wi-Fi

In addition, it is recommended (though not mandatory) to provide a screen or monitor that teams can use to present their code or other project-related materials to the judges.
