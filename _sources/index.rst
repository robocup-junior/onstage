RoboCupJunior OnStage
=====================

RoboCupJunior OnStage invites teams to design, build and program creative and autonomous physical robots. The objective is to create
a live robotic performance that uses a wide variety of technology to engage an audience. This includes a range of possible performances,
such as dance, storytelling, theater, or art installations. The performance may involve music, but this is optional. The league is
intended to be open-ended. Teams are encouraged to be creative, innovative, and entertaining, in both the design of the robots and
in the design of the overall performance.

This page lists various websites, documents, posters, videos, and other resources relevant for RoboCupJunior OnStage teams, organizers and judges.
It is supposed to gather all relevant resources in one place.
