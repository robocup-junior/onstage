Team Area
=========

The team area is reserved exclusively for participating teams. It should be designed to provide participants with easy access to their work tables and the stage. At the same time, it must be clearly separated from the public to prevent interference from mentors or parents, as participants are expected to work independently on their projects.

The figure below illustrates an exemplary layout of the team area, including two practice stages, the work tables, and a reception desk.

   Exemplary layout of the team area

Practice Stages
---------------

The practice stages are intended to give teams the opportunity to rehearse their performances before their scheduled time on the main stage. They do not need to be elevated, but must be made from the exact same material as the main stage. The dimensions of the performance area should also match those of the main stage exactly. Additional surrounding space beyond the performance area is not required.

The number of required practice stages depends on the number of teams:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Number of Teams
     - Practice Stage Requirement
   * - 0 – 10
     - No practice stage needed if main stage is available for practice between slots
   * - 10 – 20
     - One practice stage needed
   * - 20 - 30
     - Two practice stages needed

A table with a chair should be placed near the practice stages and staffed by a volunteer responsible for managing practice slot bookings. This ensures that booked time slots are honored by the teams.

If the reception desk is located close to the practice stages, it can also serve as the booking point for practice slots.

Work Tables
-----------

The work tables will serve as the primary workspace for participants throughout the competition. Teams will use them to develop both the hardware and software of their robots. Each table must therefore be equipped with **at least two power outlets**, capable of supporting a soldering iron, multiple computers, and small battery chargers.

Power should be turned off overnight when no participants are present, to ensure building safety.

Each team requires a dedicated area of at least 2.5 by 3.0 meters, including a table with a minimum length of 1.8 meters.
If a separate storage area is available for props and large robots, this space is sufficient. However, if no such storage is provided, additional space must be allocated at each team’s work area to accommodate their equipment.

Storage Area
------------

If additional space is available within the team area, part of it should be designated as a storage area where teams can keep large props or robots when not in use.
While teams remain responsible for their equipment at all times, this storage area should be positioned away from walkways to ensure safety.

Reception Desk
--------------

The reception desk will be staffed with volunteers who monitor the entrance to ensure that only participants have access to the team area. They will also act as the first point of contact for any questions from the teams.

A screen should be placed near the reception desk to continuously display the event schedule and other general information relevant to the teams. This information may be provided via a website, which the screen or a connected device must be able to access and display.
